retranse INSTALLATION

1. Requirements
================================================================================

retranse currently compiles only on POSIX systems.
It has been tested in a Ubuntu Linux 9.04.

The programs needed to compile retranse are g++ compiler and make.
The Perl Regular Expression Library `libpcre' and its C++ wrapper `libpcre++' 
are also required. 

In a debian distro the above can be installed by installing the packages
with names: `g++', `make' and 'libpcre++-dev'. The package `libpcre++-dev'
depends on `libpcre3-dev' and installs it automatically.

To install these packages open a terminal and type:

	sudo apt-get install g++ make libpcre++-dev

Note that in different systems, the installation procedure and package names
may vary.


2. Installation
================================================================================

In a new directory, unzip or download the source code of retranse.
While in the retranse source code directory type:

	make

and the retranse library and interpreter will be both compiled.
After that, if you wish to install the retranse library into /usr/local type:

	sudo make install

and the retranse libraries and headers will be installed.


3. Unstalling retranse
================================================================================

To remove retranse libraries from /usr/local go to the source code directory
and type:

	sudo make uninstall
